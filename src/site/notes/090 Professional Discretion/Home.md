# [[090 Professional Discretion/Home\|Home]]
## Purpose of this site
*This is a work in progress! New material and updates will be published in the coming time, therefore several links may not work yet .*

This site is an attempt to analyse the changing and more and more complex situation in which present day experts/professionals try to do their work. For this analysis we have to [[090 Professional Discretion/Focus on discretion in individual professional work\|focus on discretion]] because, in my opinion, this is [[090 Professional Discretion/The kernel of professional work\|the kernel of professional work]]

But first we have to answer some questions. What are experts and professionals? [[090 Professional Discretion/Is everyone a professional\|Is every expert a professional]], and are all professionals more or less the same? In order to find answers, it is necessary to look into what the literature on professionals have to offer with respect to the theoretical views on the phenomenon of discretion. Also it is necessary to look in what circumstances experts do their work.

Furthermore we need to analyse carefully [[091 Nog te bewerken/Changes in the situation of professionals\|what has changed in the situation of professionals]] and what makes many professionals are of opinion that they are in a crisis, and that all kind of ‘powers’ (and especially managers and politicians) strive towards [[091 Nog te bewerken/De-professionalization\|de-professionalization]]. And what is the relation with discretion.

It is the aim of this site to demonstrate that we are in the middle of a transition period from a traditional to a new or modern professionalism in which professionalsand experts can work in and outside organisations but have to deal with [[091 Nog te bewerken/Pressures upon professionals\|all kind of pressures]] upon them. I am not pretending to offer definitive answers to all questions, or to understand all what could be understood about experts and professionals. In various places I will pay attention to questions without giving a clear answer, or just point to an interesting phenomenon without knowing how to categorise it.
