# The kernel of expert work
I already mentioned that in my opinion discretion is the kernel of expert or professional work[^3]. Not all kind of work, but work where the person or organisation that wants the work to be done, is of opinion that she or he doesn't have the necessary knowledge and skills to do the job, and so needs an expert or professional. So let's explore the nature of such work more closely.

First of all the problem at hand (or the service that is needed) will be more or less *complex*. Complex means that the problem or service has multiple aspects and the solution is not obvious. Also important is that, although the problem may be 'known', the situation in which the problem occurs is complex, and must be taken into account. In short, the client does not know what to do.
There is another kind of complex problems: in these problems it is not the complex nature of the problem as such, but the situation in which it has to be solved. Examples of such problems are the interpretation of laws and regulations in concrete cases, or the specific help a client needs in a poverty situation.

Furthermore, the solving of the problem is important for the 'problem-holder' or [[091 Nog te bewerken/Who is the client\|client]]: it can be a question of life or dead, or just a financial one, but there is a certain *importance*.
Also the problem needs to be solved, immediately (e.g. after a car accident), soon (e.g. a decision has to be taken in the next board meeting), or in due time (e.g. next year when a bridge needs to be replaced). So there is a kind of *urgency*. 

However, in many cases there is not enough knowledge to find a clear-cut solution for the problem in these specific circumstances, and waiting until enough knowledge is available is no option. So the expert has to interpret the problem and the circumstances to choose the 'best' solution. This can be a more or less 'proven' solution that is used in other more or less comparable situations, but also it is possible that the expert is of opinion she/he has to act differently, given the problem and the circumstances. This is what is called *discretion*: the freedom of the expert to act according to his/her 'reading' of the problem and situation.

All of the above means that there is a client with a problem for which the solution is not readily available. Therefore there is *uncertainty* regarding the solution to the problem[^2]. For the client it is important whether the expert that he/she calls in to solve the problem can be *trust*ed, in the sense of: does the expert have sufficient knowledge and skills to solve the problem as well as possible.
## Discretion and complexity
Discretion is the kernel of expert work because of the complexity of the problems the expert is dealing with or the service she/he delivers. Champy states: “complexity should be placed at the heart of the study of professional work” (2018, p. 1). As said before, this complexity asks for specialised knowledge and skills, above the knowledge and skills of the client. 
Actually, more than knowledge and skills are needed. For discretion even more important is experience, and based thereon: trained intuition[^4]. Both are necessary for a correct use of discretion. 
Based on the above, an circumscription of discretion could be:
*Discretion is the freedom of the expert to act according to the expert's specialized knowledge, training, experience and trained intuition, while taking into account the specific characteristics and circumstances of the client or client system.* 

The freedom for [[050 Inbox/Discretion is granted\|discretion is granted]] by the client (at least implicitly), and sometimes is legitimated by 'official' others (which helps to trust the expert).
Discretion is based on the unpredictability or indeterminacy of the ‘best’ way to provide the service or solve the problem. This unpredictability is a consequence of three types of uncertainty: incomplete theories, imprecise measurement of relevant characteristics of the client or her/his situation, and uncertainty due to other factors beyond the scope or domain of the profession. Unpredictability calls for special knowledge and skills based on abstract theories and concepts and training-based and experience-based intuition. Especially important here is that the expert always has to judge whether standard actions (like protocols) can be used, or whether the specific constellation of the problem and circumstances of the client (-system) asks for another action. Noordegraaf calls this work therefor ‘inferential’ and ‘experiential’ (2005, pp. 4–5). So unpredictability, knowledge and especially discretion are the elements that play a central role in expert work.
#### Footnotes
[^2]: Jamous and Peloille (1970) indicate this uncertainty with a ratio between indeterminacy (I) and technicality (T; their word for the knowledge that is available). The more indeterminacy (higher I/T ratio) the more uncertainty.
[^3]: Again, I use 'expert' which includes 'professional'. See [[091 Nog te bewerken/The difference between expert and professional work\|The difference between expert and professional work]]
[^4]: Champy (2018, p. 4) uses the expressions 'prudentiality' and 'practical wisdom' as synonyms for this, but I prefer 'trained intuition'or 'educated guesses' because this stresses the scientific base and training.
