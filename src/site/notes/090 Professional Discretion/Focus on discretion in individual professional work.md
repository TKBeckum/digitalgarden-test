# [[090 Professional Discretion/Focus on discretion in individual professional work\|Focus on discretion in individual professional work]]
In this contribution on professional or expert[^1] discretion I will focus in three different ways: a focus on <u>discretion</u>, on <u>individual</u> professionals/experts, and on professional/expert <u>work</u>.
*Focus on discretion*: there are many aspects of the work of experts that can be discussed, but from my point of view discretion is the most important of all these aspects. Later I will explain that [[090 Professional Discretion/The kernel of professional work\|discretion is the kernel of professional work]].
*Focus on individual experts*: in much discussion on professionals, the focus is on the way professional groups try to achieve status, closure, exclusive rights, and better payment. In the contribution on this site, however, I will look at what individual experts in their individual jobs experience in relation to discretion.
*Focus on expert work*: I focus on expert work instead of being an expert. Individuals can do expert work during part of their working time, and do another type of expert work during another part. Examples are doctors treating patients who also teach at a university. They perform two types of expert work alternating, and sometimes at the same time.

In the following I will detail what kind of work we are talking about when discussing discretion. Next the concept of discretion is discussed in more detail, after which the different sources of  discretion will be sketched. Then the developments that are relevant for the discussion on discretion are discussed. Also I will try to develop some ideas about the way individual experts can relate to the developments sketched before.

***Discretion*** 
Below I will say much more on the issue of discretion, but for the moment I  suffice with a provisional description of the concept. Discretion refers to the ability of an individual expert to make informed and responsible decisions based on their own judgment and expertise. Discretion allows for a level of freedom. However, later on it will become clear that it is a freedom within restrictions.

[^1]: In this article on discretion I regularly us the term 'expert' to avoid the connotations with all kinds of discussions on 'what are professionals'. But where I speak about 'expert' one may read 'professional' as well. Not the other way around. When the term 'professional' is used I refer to the professional as treated in the professionalism and professionalization discussions.
