# Purpose of this site
*This is a work in progress! New material and updates will be published in the coming time.*

This site is an attempt to analyse the changing and more and more complex situation in which present day professionals try to do their work. But first we have to answer some questions. What are professionals? What makes a professional, and are all professionals more or less the same? In order to find answers, it is necessary to look into what the literature on professionals have to offer with respect to the theoretical views on the phenomenon of professionals. Also it is necessary to look in what circumstances professionals do their work.

Furthermore we need to analyse carefully what has changed in the situation of professionals and what makes that many professionals are of opinion that they are in crisis, and that all kind of ‘powers’ (and especially managers) strive towards de-professionalization. It is the aim of this site to demonstrate that we are in the middle of a transition period from a traditional to new or modern professionalism in which professionals can work in and outside organisations. I am not pretending to offer definitive answers to all questions, or to understand all what could be understood about professionals. On different occasions I will pose questions without an answer, or just point to an interesting phenomenon without knowing how to categorise it.
