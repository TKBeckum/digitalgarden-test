# Is everyone a professional?
Who is a professional and who is not? In many dictionaries it says that a professional is someone who does a job for a living, compared to an ‘amateur’ who does it just for fun. So we have professional football players, golfers, magicians, and so on. In this sense everyone with a paid job is a professional. But that is not the kind of professionals this blog book will be about. So in dictionaries ‘professional’ also is described as “a person who has the type of job that needs a high level of education and training”[^1]

In a following blog posts I will discuss more precisely what makes a professional, but for the moment we could describe a professional as someone with a lot of knowledge and expertise who delivers services to clients (individuals or organisations), like a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer.

### Professionals, experts and technicians

In general we call someone with a lot of knowledge or expertise an expert. So, is expert a synonym for professional? Yes and no: a professional should be an expert in his or her field, but not all experts are professionals. An important difference between a professional and an expert is that the latter is bound to the standard procedures learned during education and training. Professionals also use their experience and intuition in deciding what to do; they can divert from the standard procedures. Of course also experts could do so, but what is important is that professionals are allowed (even obliged) to do so when they think this is the best way. So here we see the client (and sometimes society) comes into the play, because it is the client who allows some well-educated and trained experts to do so. In a later blog post I will look into this phenomenon more closely.

What about technicians? Normally we use this term for workers who execute jobs where physical objects are manipulated in a complicated way that need special skills, like electronic technicians, computer technicians and chemical operators do. Some professionals are highly skilled technicians (think of a brain surgeon) too, but it is the ‘permission’ to take intuition and experience into account that makes the difference.

### Professionals and artists

What about artists? Intuition is important for artists as well, but most important for artists is creativity. Creativity is the ability to create something new and unexpected, to approach a known phenomenon from an unexpected angle. Some professionals are in the front of their field because they also are creative and use this creativity in their professional job. But most professionals are not artists. However, there are professionals that are close to being an artist (or can be considered both), like architects and industrial designers.

### Professionals and semi-professionals

In much literature about professionals a distinction is made between traditional or ‘real’ professionals and ‘semi-professionals’ or ‘aspiring professionals’. The real professionals are considered the ‘free’ (in the sense of self-employed) or ‘learned’ professionals, like doctors and lawyers. These professionals have a long tradition, and in many societies also have a high status. In a following blog post we will see that they deal with very important aspects of life: health, ownership, and freedom. The (so-called) semi- or aspiring professionals are rather new kind of jobs that deal with less important aspects of life (at least, according to ‘society’), and generally have not a high status.

Later on it will become clear that the distinction between ‘real’ and ‘semi- or aspiring’ professionals is not one I will use in this blog book. But I will distinguish between two groups of professionals: professionals that belong to an organised profession that influences the work of professionals, and other professionals. This distinction comes close to the above, but not exactly.
